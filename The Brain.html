<h2>What Is the Frontal Cortex? And How Does it Make Me?</h2>
<p>There are three main parts of the brain, The Cerebrum, The Cerebellum, and The Brain stem. Inside of the Cerebrum is the Frontal Cortex, also refered to as the Frontal Lobe. The Frontal Lobe does lots of things other than your forming your personality. It also; Manages attention, Helps you understand and react to others feelings, Helps with some speech and language production, Some motor skills, Comparison, and Forming memories. </p>
<h2>Certain Personality Traits</h2>
<p>It is found that when you have a dominant personality trait, such as being extroverted, the regions of your brain that control that are larger than regular. In one study, Scientist found that the people that were considered to be extroverts had bigger medial orbitofrontal cortex, a part of the brain that is just behind the eyes and controls decision making and considering rewards. Just as your brain grows and develops when you get older, so does your personality. </p>
