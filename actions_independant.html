<h2>Your Actions </h2>
<p>Your personality affects almost everything about you and that includes the way you act. Earlier we mentioned being introverted or extroverted and that has lots to do with how you act socially.</p>

<p>Different people have different reactions to the different situations they are put in and a lot of the things they do in those situations correlates to their personality. Using the introvert and extrovert example, if you went to a party you are way more likely to see the extrovert dancing, singing, talking, etc. But you would think its unusual to see an introvert doing most of those thing. Most introverts wouldn't even be at that party! Just because their brain has grown and developed differently they experience things differently and react to those things differently. Even though your brain has a huge part in this, there are still some other factors that influence the choices you make. In this short video you will have how the choices other people around you make and how they can greatly influence your actions. </p>
